Subscription, Free Trial, and Payments
Free Trial Policy
We offer a free trial to new users, which requires valid payment information to activate.
By signing up for the free trial, you agree that the trial cannot be canceled until after the first billing cycle.
Reason for this Policy:
To prevent abuse of our services, including unauthorized use of sensitive features such as access to private contact information.

After the trial period ends, you will automatically transition to a paid subscription unless canceled in accordance with these Terms.

Subscription fees are billed according to the selected plan.
All payments are processed securely through our payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).

Users may request subscription cancellation at any time by following the instructions on our cancellation page.
Please note that cancellation requests made during the free trial period will take effect only after the first month’s payment has been processed.
Refund Policy
All sales are final, and refunds are not provided due to the nature of our site and the services we offer.
Why This Policy Exists
This policy ensures that users accessing private, sensitive, or secure information—such as member profiles or contact details—are committed to the integrity of the platform. Abuse of free trials can compromise the experience for other users and harm the overall trust and safety of our services.
